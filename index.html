      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p class="about_p">
        At Loved Pets Animal Rescue, we believe all animals deserve a chance to find a loving forever home.
        We provide initial veterinary care to rescued animals, then work to match each animal with a human 
        family to love them and keep them safe forever. All animals are screened for diseases upon arrival,
        washed and groomed, and then added to our website for adoptive families to see. All potential
        adoptive families are also screened for adoption history, household lifestyle, and commitment to
        providing a safe and loving home.
        <br>
        <br>
        We can always use volunteers to help keep our shelter open! Volunteers are needed to bathe and
        groom animals, play with pets to help them socialize and keep them happy, clean kennels and
        screening rooms, and help with administrative tasks in the office. If you are interested in volunteering,
        please complete the steps below.

    <p class="volunteer_section_p">If you are unable to adopt a pet, becomming a volunteer is the next best thing. 
       You can help to take care of these pets until they find loving homes of their own.
       By donating your time and energy you are helping both the shelter and these animals 
       who deserve love and a healthy place to live. Please consider volunteering if you 
       have the time, your kindness will not go to waste.
